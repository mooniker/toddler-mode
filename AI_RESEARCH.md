# AI Safety and Responsible Use Primer

## Overview

A short primer on responsible AI use, bias considerations, and safe experimentation guidelines.

## Key Bias Considerations

- Data bias can propagate to models and outputs.
- Mitigation strategies include diverse data, auditing, and human-in-the-loop review.

## Safe Experimentation Checklist

- Define scope and constraints before starting.
- Avoid sensitive or personal data in experiments.
- Validate outputs with human review.
- Document assumptions and limitations.
